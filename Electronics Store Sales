# How this can help a buisness out.
I created a table with names and emails that customers provided. I also created 
another table that shows what their customer ID is, what they purchased, and
how much they spent. I joined these tables toghether into one table to simiplify 
the process and show diffrent things such customers with their name listed,
email listed, and what they purchased and for how much to make it easier to see.
I also specified the querey to show all customers who only bought a specific
item, in this example it was an Iphone. I also used two different queries
to show the name of customers and how much total they spent who only spent below
a certain amount, as well as another query that showed the name of the customer
and how many items they ordered.
